Practice accumulations and nested loops

Assignment
You have been hired by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to write a program that will help them analyze traffic patterns.  The DOT has put out traffic counters on several city roads and needs to know the average number of vehicles that travel each road per day and the overall number and average number of vehicles that have traveled over all roads.   The DOT has hired an individual to handle all data entry.

Your program should ask for the number of roads surveyed and, for each road, the number of days that the counters were installed.  It should calculate and output the average number of vehicles traveled down each road per day as well as the total number of vehicles and the average number of vehicles for all of the roads.

A sample input/output is below.  Possible input by DOT employee is in italics.

How many roads were surveyed?  3
How many days was road 1 surveyed?  4
	How many cars traveled on day 1? 20
	How many cars traveled on day 2? 30
	How many cars traveled on day 3? 15
	How many cars traveled on day 4? 45
Road 1 average vehicles per day: 27.5
How many days was road 2 surveyed?  3
	How many cars traveled on day 1? 40
	How many cars traveled on day 2? 30
	How many cars traveled on day 3? 50
Road 2 average vehicles per day: 40.0
How many days was road 3 surveyed?  5
	How many cars traveled on day 1? 30
	How many cars traveled on day 2? 60
	How many cars traveled on day 3? 15
	How many cars traveled on day 4? 55
	How many cars traveled on day 5? 20
Road 3 average vehicles per day: 36.0
Total number of vehicles traveled on all roads: 410
Average number of vehicles per road: 136.67


Your input and output should be in the same order and format as the example.
