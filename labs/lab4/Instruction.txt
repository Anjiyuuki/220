Learning objectives
Develop a Python program that uses the author's graphics package.

Assignment
Write a program that displays a heart. Use the author's graphics packages, graphics.py. It is left up to you what the details of the finished product should look like.

To make the program more fun, there should be an arrow that shoots through your heart. Again it is up to you to decide what this should look like. Use a loop to make the arrow move.  

The loop that makes the movement may go too fast. To slow it down, use the sleep() function from the time library that is a part of Python.  You will need to import the library into your code.  The line time.sleep(0.1) will make the program pause for one tenth of a second.

When the heart first appears (before it gets shot), display a greeting like, "Happy Valentineâ€™s Day!"

After the animation has finished, have the message "Click anywhere to close" appear centered at the bottom of the window. Get a mouse click and then close the window.
